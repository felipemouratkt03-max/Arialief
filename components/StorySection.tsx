            I used to love my morning walks. But slowly, almost imperceptibly, those walks became a chore. Then they became a burden. Eventually, they became a nightmare. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It started as a faint tingling—like my feet had "fallen asleep" and were taking forever to wake up. But by the time I hit 60, that tingling had turned into a relentless, burning sensation. Every step felt like I was <strong>walking on broken glass</strong>.

            The nights were the worst. I’d lay in bed, exhausted, but as soon as the sheets touched my feet, the "electric shocks" would start. Sharp, jolting stabs that would make me sit bolt upright in the dark. I felt like a prisoner in my own skin.

            I saw specialists, underwent testing, and walked away with a mountain of prescriptions. Some of those little white pills made me so groggy I felt like I was living underwater. I couldn't drive, I couldn't focus on a book, and I certainly didn't feel like "me."
          </p>
          <p>
            Then there were the creams. Greasy, menthol-scented ointments that promised instant relief but only left me with ruined socks and a sticky mess. Every doctor visit ended the same way: a sympathetic nod.
          </p>

            I refused to believe that. I wasn't ready to spend my golden years in a recliner, afraid to even pick up my granddaughter because I couldn't trust my own hands to feel her weight.

            The breakthrough didn't happen in a sterile clinic. It happened during a conversation with a friend who had dealt with her own share of health hurdles. She looked at me with a knowing smile. 
          </p>
          <p>
            "Sarah," she said, "most of what they give us is just trying to mask the noise. Why not try to fix the wiring instead?"
          </p>
          <p>
            She told me about a specific, science-backed approach she’d discovered—one that used natural compounds to calm the overactive nerves and actually support the nerve fibers from the inside out. For the first time in years, I felt a flicker of real hope.
